<h3 id="internet"><strong>What Is The Internet?</strong></h3>
<p> A cable made of optical fibers that connects computers all over the world. Optical fibers are just fibers made of very thin glass that (link to resource) can carry light through them. These cables are wrapped in a material that can reflect light so that it can't escape. If you would like to read more on the topic, follow this <a href="https://www.nai-group.com/optical-fiber-technology-how-it-works/">link.</a></p><br>

<p> This is beyond the scope of what Andrei talked about so skip this if you want. But for those curious, when a server from somewhere in the world sends your browser the file it's looking for, the data(currently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data">digitally stored</a>) is transferred-through that cable we talked about earlier-as light signals!Cool huh? That light is encoded with data and travels that cable until it gets where it needs to be and then is transformed into electrical signals or <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro">electro- magnetic waves</a> to show up on your device. </p>
<p>I think of it like drinking with a straw- the straw being the optical fiber cable/internet and the drink being the light. You can't use just anything as a straw. You can only use what is of the kind of material that can transport liquid. It allows the liquid to come to your mouth in a concentrated way. And if that liquid is something like soda, it has things in it like sugar.I don't know what all comes in soda(also I rather say coke but I'm going to say soda as not to be distractring.) In the same the light can carry data to the destination it needs to get to.</p>


<h3 id="possibility"><strong>Um.. How Is That Even Possible??</strong></h3>
<img src="https://www.tech-faq.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/how-computers-are-made.jpg" width="100" height="100">
<p>I am no computer scientist..yet. But I can take a stab at it. A computer is made up of electrical switches that respond to electrical impulses. These switches are in the pattern of 0's and 1's. I don't know if you know yet that computers only understand 0's and 1's- but not as numbers. They are more like on/off or true/false. Is the switch on or not? This is also how computers commuicate. The 0's and 1's are individually called <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:digital-information/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:bits-and-bytes/a/bits-binary-digits">bits</a> which is the smallest unit of data in a computer.  Those optical fibers mentioned earlier? Yeah,they are very thin fibers so they can only represent a 1 or 0. This is why there are so many fibers in those cables. The light going through the cable that represents 1 will have a stronger current than the light going through the cable that represents 0. This is how the computer knows what to do. And this means all types of data- text, images, video, etc. Guess how the compuer knows what kind of digital data is being carried. I'll wait.... you're right! The programmer tells it!!<p>
	<p>Like how do you know what kind of soda it is? (Assuming you don't know it by the taste.)Someone probably told you. Whether it was on the bottle/can or someone verbally told you. In the same way, the computer must be told what kind of data is being brought to it. </p>

<h3 id="browsing"><strong>Sooooo... What Does This Have To Do With Browsing The Web?</strong></h3>
<img src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2021/06/11/Microsoft.jpg" width="100" height="100">
<p>When you search for page/file on your browser, your browser has to find that file. If it doesn't know where to look for it, it asks your Internet Service Provider(ISP), which is how you are connected to the internet. The ISP asks the Domain Name Server(DNS) for the address of whatever name the broswer sent. The DNS is basically the address book of the internet. Everything connected to the internet has an address called an IP address, like a home address. We normally see domain names for IP addresses like "google.com" or "facebook.com" instead of "142.250.188.46" or "157.240.229.35", respectively. Some one could probably remember all those numbers but um.. it's a no thanks for me. If you would like to play around with finding domain name addresses, use this <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx">website</a> to get the address of any page you want. Type the number into a browser and see what happens.</p>
<p>Back to the story. So your browser has the address of where the file is. Now it needs to go ahead and send that letter declaring its love. I'm kidding. Since it has the address, it sends a request to that address. The file lives at a server. A server is just a high leveled computer that stores files and can get them for you. The server gets the request and sends that file or files back to your browser via the internet...via light signals.The files are broken down as 'packets' or 'packages'so they can move faster through the cable but once they get to your device, they are put back together. I wish explaining this was as fast as this internet process. Wooo!*wipes iamginary sweat from forehead* </p>

<h3 id="story"><strong>A Story That Helps Me Put It All Together</strong></h3>

<p>Ok so imagine you get hungry and want to eat your favorite food but you're broke so you ask your mom for some money. She says she's broke too and that she will get you grandma's cashapp to ask her. Why her cashapp, you say? Well Grandma wants to practice using cashapp and it's the best way to reach her for money. Come to find out, Mom doesn't remember Grandma's cashapp. Wow, Ma. She ends up asking her brother, your uncle, for the cashapp tag. He sends it to her and she sends it to you. At this point, you're about to dip into bill money, but you chose to be patient and request the money from Grandma. Grandma sends it to you right away! Boom. You have the tacos you wanted. [Insert smile] In the same way when when you pull up a broswer and go to a page, you browser essentially requests the page from the correct server using the IP address. Imagine you requested money from the wrong cashapp tag. You wouldn't get a thing. And just how Grandma sends the money to you, the server sends your browser the page it's requesting. </p>

<p>As the programmer, you are the pioneer of this. You cause it to happen. Without you, there would be no web page, no google, no facebook. None of it. You communicate with the computer. You tell it what to do. You make sure files are being sent at the fastest speed it can. You make dreams come true. </p>
